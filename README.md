AutoMata Pipelines + XDoTool Menu

Automation for “puppet users”

This project is made up of two separate tools that pair together to automate menial, repetitive tasks on a laptop or server—what I like to call a puppet user.

Think:

- Bots without APIs

- Automation without writing real code

- Turning a machine into a very obedient puppet

#What Is This?

AutoMata Pipelines and XDoTool Menu are designed to work together to automate almost anything that can be done with a keyboard and mouse.

AutoMata Pipelines handle the logic and flow

XDoTool Menu handles the physical interaction (typing, clicking, moving)

Together, they let you build automation without needing to be a programmer—or even knowing Bash, if you don’t want to.

AutoMata Pipelines

AutoMata Pipelines are preprogrammed workflows.

Call them:

-workflows

-sequences

-formula

-order of operations

We call them pipelines.

A pipeline is a predetermined series of events where you plug in your own script, prompt, or content. The structure is already built—you just decide what happens inside it.

Example Pipelines

Message response pipeline
Just provide the text (or AI prompt). The pipeline handles the rest.

AI caption → automatic posting pipeline

Generate captions using AI

Post automatically

One post per day, or on a user-defined delay (minutes/hours)

Social media automation

AI captioning

Scheduled posting

Rate-limited, repeatable, hands-off

You focus on what should happen. The pipeline handles when and how.

XDoTool

XDoTool is a command-line tool for automating:

Keyboard input

Mouse movement

Clicks

Window focus

In short: it lets a computer behave like a human using the GUI.

XDoTool Menu

XDoTool is powerful—but people love saying:

“Not everyone knows how to write code.”

Cool. So here’s a tool that does it for you.

XDoTool Menu is a menu-driven system for creating Bash scripts filled with XDoTool commands—without writing them by hand.

Pick actions from a menu

Generate Bash scripts automatically

Edit manually if you want (optional)

No scripting knowledge required

It lowers the barrier from “learn Bash” to “click some options.”

Why Pair Them?

On their own, they’re useful.
Together, they’re dangerous (in a good way).

AutoMata Pipelines decide what happens.
XDoTool Menu makes it physically happen on the system.

This combo lets you automate anything that doesn’t have an API.

What Can You Do With This?

🤖 Make bots to farm coins or XP in video games

💬 Annoy Discord users using Google Gemini to read messages and generate responses

📅 Automate daily social media posts with AI-generated captions

🖥 Turn a server or laptop into a fully automated “user”

🔁 Eliminate repetitive, soul-crushing tasks

If a human can do it with a keyboard and mouse, this can automate it.

Philosophy

This project exists because:

Automation shouldn’t require gatekeeping

“Just learn to code” is a lazy answer

Computers are good at boring things—let them do the boring things

You don’t need to know Bash.
You don’t need to know XDoTool.
You don’t even need to know what you’re doing—just what you want done.
